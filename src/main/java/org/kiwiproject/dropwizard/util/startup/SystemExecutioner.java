/**
 * Wrapper around {@link System#exit(int)} for situations in which the JVM must be exited. This class is mainly
 * intended for scenarios in which production code may call {@link System#exit(int)} in order to allow unit testing
 * of the exit behavior, but without actually exiting the JVM. For example, a Jetty server that cannot start due to
 * failure to obtain a port, or any other non-recoverable startup error that would otherwise result in a hung or
 * unresponsive server, application, resource, etc. In situations like this, you can test that the
 * {@link SystemExecutioner} would have exited when specific errors occur.
 * <p>
 * The no-args constructor uses the {@link ExecutionStrategies.SystemExitExecutionStrategy}, which uses
 * {@link System#exit(int)} to terminate the JVM. You can supply your own {@link ExecutionStrategy} as well, for
 * example {@link ExecutionStrategies.NoOpExecutionStrategy} is useful in unit tests (so it doesn't actually terminate
 * the JVM).
